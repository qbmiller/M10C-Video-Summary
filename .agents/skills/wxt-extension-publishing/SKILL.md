# WXT Extension Publishing to Chrome Web Store

This skill details the correct workflow for initializing authentication credentials and submitting a WXT browser extension to the Chrome Web Store. 

## 1. Google Cloud Console Preparation
To use the automated submission API, you must have an OAuth Client ID configured correctly:
1. Go to your [Google Cloud Console Credentials Page](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials).
2. Click **+ CREATE CREDENTIALS** and choose **OAuth client ID**.
3. **CRITICAL STEP**: For the **Application type**, you must select **Desktop app** (桌面应用). If you select "Web application", the authorization flow will fail with a `redirect_uri_mismatch` error (`urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob` is only allowed for native desktop apps).
4. Save your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

## 2. Initialize Submission Configuration
Run the initialization command interactively:
```bash
pnpx wxt submit init
```
During the prompt:
1. Select the stores you want to configure (e.g., `Chrome Web Store`).
2. Enter your extension ID (found on the Chrome Developer Dashboard).
3. Enter your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** (created as a "Desktop app" in step 1).
4. When asked `Generate new refresh token?`, select **Yes**.
5. The console will output an authorization URL starting with `https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth...`.
6. Open the link in a browser, log in with your developer account, and grant access.
7. Copy the **Auth Code** provided on the success page and paste it back into your terminal.

> **💡 Pro-Tip for Firefox (`FIREFOX_EXTENSION_ID`):**  
> If you are configuring Firefox and your Firefox Addon UUID contains curly braces (e.g., `{c8efa7cc-...}`), the underlying publishing tool currently has a bug that strips the braces and causes `404 Not Found` API errors. To fix this, use your extension's **URL Slug** (e.g., `m10c-web-page-video-to-mindmap`) as the `FIREFOX_EXTENSION_ID` instead of the UUID.

This process will successfully write the configurations, including `CHROME_REFRESH_TOKEN`, to a local `.env.submit` file.

> **Security Note:** Ensure that `.env.submit` and `.env.submit.backup-*` are added to your `.gitignore` to prevent leaking tokens.

## 3. Package the Extension
Before submitting, build and package the extension into a `.zip` file:
```bash
pnpm run zip
# or simply run: wxt zip
```
The packaged file will be generated in the `.output/` folder (e.g., `.output/m10c-video-summary-extension-3.0.1-chrome.zip`).

## 4. Submit for Review
Finally, use the `wxt submit` CLI (which utilizes `publish-browser-extension` under the hood) to upload the zip to the Chrome Web Store and submit it for review:

```bash
pnpx wxt submit --chrome-zip .output/<YOUR_EXTENSION_ZIP_FILE_NAME>.zip
```

The CLI will check the ZIP file, fetch an access token, upload the ZIP, and automatically submit it for review.
